# typemach
TypeMach is a bot whose purpose is to type text as quickly as possible. It's mainly used in the game TypeRacer but it could work for other applications too.
The bot is easy to use, just screenshot an area of the screen which contains text and let it do the rest. Make sure you've selected a text field before you activate the bot.

I do not condone cheating, and I did not create this bot with the intention to cheat. I made it purely for fun.

Made with the help of the Tesseract OCR engine and its dependencies.
